# Riemannian geometry tool

The purpose of this tool is to numerically calculate geodesic paths on surfaces in space. The program allows for the calculation of geodesics on a variety of surfaces and provides output in the form of a graphical plot. Additionally, it allows for obtaining an analytical expression of the Christoffel symbols and in the future, it will also provide the Gaussian curvature.

Here are some examples of geodesic plotting :
